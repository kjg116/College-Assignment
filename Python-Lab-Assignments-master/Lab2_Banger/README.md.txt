Python Lab Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment was to create a class for the driver(1).py file. This class creates an object "Banger" with three attributes (driver, model, number of hits).

The class has 4 methods: get_driver (return the name of the driver), get_model (return the model of the vehicle), get_hits (return the number of times the car was hit), add_hits (add hit to a car).

The driver(1).py is the file that contains the banger game. The file opens a text file named "competitors.txt" which contains the names of the drivers and car. The program then loops through the game until there is one car left.
