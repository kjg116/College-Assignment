Python Lab Assignment 1 |
Valid_ISBN |
Date Created: 08-28-14

Checks to see if the ISBN inputted by the user is an valid ISBN-13

The program uses the last digit of the ISBN-13 to check against the result of the following equation:

a + [b * 3] + c + [d * 3] + e + [f * 3] + g + [h * 3] + i + [j * 3] + k + [l * 3]

The program returns "This is a valid ISBN" If the check digit equals the result mod 10.

Python Lab Assignment 2 |
Banger |
Date Created: 09-11-2014

The purpose of this assignment was to create a class for the driver(1).py file. This class creates an object "Banger" with three attributes (driver, model, number of hits).

The class has 4 methods: get_driver (return the name of the driver), get_model (return the model of the vehicle), get_hits (return the number of times the car was hit), add_hits (add hit to a car).

The driver(1).py is the file that contains the banger game. The file opens a text file named "competitors.txt" which contains the names of the drivers and car. The program then loops through the game until there is one car left.
